# Sleep by Eric Whitacre: A Choral Masterpiece
 
Sleep is a choral composition by American composer Eric Whitacre, written in 2000. It is based on a poem by Charles Anthony Silvestri, who wrote the text specifically for Whitacre's music. The poem is a meditation on the journey into sleep and dreams, using imagery of night, stars, and the sea. The music is expressive, lush, and harmonically rich, creating a sublime musical statement of release and quiet resolve.

The piece was originally commissioned by the Master Chorale of Tampa Bay, Florida, under the direction of Dr. James Bass. Whitacre had initially planned to set Robert Frost's poem Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening, but was denied permission by the Frost estate. He then asked Silvestri, a friend and collaborator, to write a new poem that would match the music he had already composed. Silvestri wrote Sleep in one night, and Whitacre adapted his music to fit the new text.
 
Sleep has become one of Whitacre's most popular and performed works, and has been recorded by several choirs, including his own professional ensemble, the Eric Whitacre Singers. The piece is scored for SATB choir a cappella, with divisi in each voice part. It has a duration of about five minutes, and is considered to be of medium to advanced difficulty. The piece is published by Walton Music, and sheet music can be downloaded in PDF or MIDI format from various online sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^].

One of the distinctive features of Sleep is Whitacre's use of cluster chords, which are chords that contain adjacent notes in the scale, creating a dissonant and dense sound. Whitacre often uses these chords to create contrast and tension, and then resolves them to more consonant harmonies. For example, in the opening measures of the piece, the choir sings a series of cluster chords on the word "sleep", followed by a major chord on the word "now". This creates a sense of longing and release, as well as a musical representation of falling asleep.
 
Another characteristic of Sleep is Whitacre's use of text painting, which is a technique of composing music that reflects the meaning or mood of the words. Whitacre employs text painting throughout the piece, using various musical elements such as dynamics, tempo, rhythm, melody, and harmony. For instance, in measure 28, the choir sings "the evening hangs beneath the moon" with a descending melody and a soft dynamic, creating a sense of calmness and gravity. In measure 47, the choir sings "watching over all" with a rising melody and a crescendo, creating a sense of awe and reverence. In measure 64, the choir sings "dreams" with a syncopated rhythm and a dissonant chord, creating a sense of unpredictability and mystery.
 
Sleep is a choral masterpiece that showcases Whitacre's skill and creativity as a composer. It is a piece that challenges and rewards both singers and listeners with its beauty and complexity. It is a piece that explores the human experience of sleep and dreams, and invites us to reflect on our own inner worlds.
